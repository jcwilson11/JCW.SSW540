# Requirements Engineering
- An engineering process to 
    - establish which services the customer requires from a system
    - and the constraints under which it operates and is developed

# Requirement types
- FUnctional requirements state what the system us supposed to accomplish **(what the software should do)**
- Non-functional requirements provide constraints on the services or functions offered by the system **(adfitional features that are not directly related to the core functionality of the system)**
- User requirements (both functional non-functional) must be understanable by stakeholders who do not have a technical background **(what the user needs, Laymens term)**
- System requirements (also both functioooonal and non-functional) are more detailed requirements and include more technical information

- All requirements must be valid, specific, realistic, complete, consistenet, and vwerifiable. 
    - **Valid** - the requirement is related to the system that is being developed
    - **Specific** - the requirement is stated in a way that is specific enough to be implemented and tested
    - **Realistic** - the requirement can be implemented given the project budget and schedule
    - **Complete** - the requirement is stated in full, including all constraints and dependencies
    - **Consistent** - the requirement does not contradict any other requirement
    - **Verifiable** - the requirement can be tested to ensure that it has been implemented correctly 

# Functional Requirements
- should describe the system services in detail
- statements of services the system provide, how the system should react to particular inputs, and how the system should behave in particular situations
- functions descrive external interactions (inputs, outputs, and behaviors). 
- Also may state what the syystem should not do
    - use case detailed with other UML diagrams

# Use cases
- use cases define the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an actor) and the software toa chieve a goal
- use cases are a way to capture functional requirements

# Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- in software engineering, UML is a standard way to visualize the design of a system
- UML allows us to visualize 
    - the external interfaces of the system
    - the activities and states of a system
    - the individual components within a system and how they interact with oe another 

# UML use cases
- A full set of use cases would descrive **all possible interactions** between the system and its users
- Use cases are documented in a high level graphicval model supplemented by more detailed tabular dexcriptions
- Other UML diagrams are used to add detail to the use cases
    - **Activity diagrams** - show the flow of control from activity to activity
    - **State diagrams** - show the transistions of system state cause by external events and/or conditions
    - **Sequence diagrams** - show the dequence of event processing in the system

- Users have a stake in getting the **right system**; developers have a stake in getting the **system right**
- there are a lot of stakeholders for software systems:
    - end-users, managers, engineers involved in developments, testing and maintenance, domain experts, trade unions, etc
    - regulatory agencies (for some systems)

# Non-functional requirements
- constraints on the services of functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, and constraints on the development process, standards, etc
- NFR define how the system operates, not what a system does
- often affect the overall architecture of a system rather than the individual components
- a single NFR such as a security requirement may generate a number of related functional requiremnts that define system services that are required

# requirements interaction
- the higher the level of secuirty, the more comples the system, thus lowering the usability
- classic trade offs betyween security and usability

# Goal Vs. Requirement
- a goal: a genneral intension of the userm, suchas ease of use
- helpful to developers, as they convey the intentions of the system users, but generally not verifiable

# Requirements engineering process
## requirements elicitation: the process of collecting the requirements of a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders 
    - elicitation and analysis are sometimes called requirements discovery
    -involves technical staff working witha range of stakeholders to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide, and the system's operational constraints
    - stages include:
        - requirements discovery
        - requirements classification and organization
        - requirements prioritization and negotiation
        - requirements specification

    - Problems in elicitation
        - Stakeholders don't know what they really want
        - Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms
        - Different stakeholders have different requirements
        - organizational and political factors may influence the requirements
        - the requireents mau change during the analysis process, New stakeholders may emerge, and the business environment may change
    - Storiesa and scenarios are used to help elicit requirements
        - scenarios and user stories are real life examples of how a system can be used
        - becuase they are based ona  practical situation, stakeholders can relate to them and can comment on their own situation and needs with respect to the story
        - they help stakeholders define what they really want
        ** - For agile, stories are the requirements**
    - Scenarios 
        - a structured form of user story
        - should include 
            - a description of the starting situation
            - a description of the normal flow of events
            - a description of what can go wrong
            - info about other concurrent activities
            - a description of the state when the scenario ends

## requirements analysis: analzing the requirements to identify conflicts, omissions, and other problems
    - coherent organizzation of requirements reduces reduncancies and promotes comprehension
    - multiple stakeholders will hold conflicting requirements
    - Resolution, often via compromise, is essential to move the project forward

## requirements validation: checking the requirements for errors
    - concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customer really wants
    - requirement errors are costly, so validation is important
    - we check requirements for:
        - validity; does the system provide the functions which best support the customer's needs?
        - consistency; are the requirements consistent with each other? no conflicts?
        - completeness; are all functions required by the customer included?
        - realism; can the requirements be implemented given available budget and technology?
        - verifiability; can the requirements be tested within the implementation?
    - requirements validation techniques
        - requirements reviews; where a team of people examines the requirements
        - prototyping; using an executable model of the system to check requirements
        - test-case generation; developing test for requirements to check testability before implementation
    - beware of ambigous requirements; for example, "a user shall be able to search the appoitment list for all clinics"
        - what does "search" mean? what does "all" mean? what does "clinic" mean? what does "appointment list" mean?
    - **Asking if the requirement is verifiable often tells us if the requirement is clear and appropriate**
## requirements management: managing changes to the requirements as the system is developed and put into use
    - the process of managing changing requirements during requirements enginering process, system development, and deployment
    - decisions
        - requirements identification: each requirement must be uniquely identified so that it can be cross-referenced with other requirements
        - A change management process: the set of activities that helps the project team to manage changes to the project scope (impact and cost of changes)
        - Traceability: the ability to identify the source of each requirement and the relationship between requirements
        - Tool support: Tools that may be used ranging from speacialist requirements management systems to spreasheets and simple database systems
