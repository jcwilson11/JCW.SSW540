Slide 3:
- Commerically Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software
    - Software that is purchased or licensed from a third party
    - subscribing to a generic service, like Workday
    - can be cheaper and faster than developing in-house, but the design process becomes concerned with integrating the COTS software into the system

Slide 6:
    - Object Oriented Design (OOD)
        - A design process based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods
        - Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for objects
        - OOD is a way of thinking about software design that is based on the concept of objects
        
Slide 13:
- Approaches to identifying objects
    - grammatical approach based on a natural language description of the sys
    - tangible things in the problem domain
    - behavioral approach based on the interactions (what participates in what behavior) between objects
    - scenario-based approach based on the use cases of the system
