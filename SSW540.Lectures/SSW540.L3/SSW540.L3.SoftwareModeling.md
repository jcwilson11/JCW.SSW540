# Software Design
- Essential: know the functional and non-functional requirements
- two phases is software design
    - Hi-level (architectural) design identifies and assigns the responsibility for aspects of behavior to various modules or components of the software (and directs how the components interact)
    - Detail design level deals with the contents of individual components, their data structures, and algorithms (how to achieve high level design)
# Software system modeling
- Software system modeling is a process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system
- possible views to model:
    - system view: capturing the fit of the software with other software
    - logical/conceptual view: capturing the relationships of functions needed to address the problem
    - physical view: capturing the placement of software on various distributed hardware elements
    - process view: caputures the concurrent software actiones needed
    - developer view: capturing development team responsibilities
    - user view: capturing how the user interacts with the software

## ATM Example
- ATM system view: Captures the context of this software relative to other software systems
    - ATM <--> Network <--> Centralized Bank server <--> Account Database
- ATM conceptual (functional view): The system needs to authenticate the user, allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money, and print a receipt. Some processing funtions to address the problem include
    - ReadCard()
    - CollectPIN()
    - AuthenticateUser()
    - PresentMenu()
    - AcceptChoice()
    - Updatebank()
    - LogActivity()
- ATM Component (physical) view: The atm has system components with a combo of software and hardware needed for various functions
    - Card Reader
    - PIN Pad
    - Display
    - Printer
    - Cash Dispenser
    - Account Database
    - Activity Log

# Software system modeling (cont.)
- Typically use graphical modeling
- for software, the graphical notation is UML (Unified Modeling Language)
    - case design diagrams is part of UML
- Some UML diagreams: 
- can model either static or dynamic aspects of a system
    - Use case diagrams, which show the interactions between a system and its environment (dynamic)
    - Activity diagrams, which show the activities involved in a process or in data processing
    - Sequence diagrams, which show interactions between actors and the system and between system components
    - State diagrams, which show how the system reacts to internal and external events.
    - Class diagrams, which show the object classes in the system and the associations between these classes.

# Use Case Diagrams
- Each use case tells us what data is needed, what processing must be done, what actors are involved, etc
    - context
    - detailed instructions (user/software; software/software; software/external system)
    - enabling structures

# context models
- illustrates the operational context of a system
- shows what lies outside the system boundaries
- social/organizational concerns may affect the decision on where to posotion the system boubndaries
- static view

# Process perspevtive
- shows the other systems in the environment, not how the software works in the environment
- reveals how the software is used in broader business processes (Stevens, Disney, etc)
- bridge the software context and software interaction perspectives
- UML activity diagrams may be used to define business process models

# interaction models 
- modeling user interaction helps to identify user requirements
- modeling system to system interzaction hightlights the communication problems that may arise
- Modeling component interaction helps us understand if a proposed system structure is likely to deliver the required system performance and dependability.
- Use case diagrams and sequence diagrams are best to use

# Sequence Diagrams
- part of UML; used to model interactions among the actors and objects (software entities) within a system
- shows the sequence of interactions that take place during a particular use case or use case instance
- The objects and actors involved are listed along the top of the diagram, with a dotted line drawn vertically from these. When interactions involve an object or actor, the dotted line becomes a rectangle, called a “lifeline” (the actor/object comes to life).
- interactions between actors/objects are indicated by annotated arrows.
- key elements of a sequence diagram:
    - Object/actor constructs go across the top of the diagram
    - each object has a lifeline - a dashed decending line
    - lifelines are "active" (become rectangles) wjem tje object is involved in an interaction
    - interactions should proceed accordingly to time, beginning on the left and moving right, top moving down
    - responding actions are dashed (horizontal lines)

# Behavioral Models
- capture the **dynamic behavior** of a system as it is executing. They show what happens or what is suppsoed to happen when a system repsonds to a stimulus from its environment
- two types of stimuli:
    - **Data**: Some data arrives that has to be processed by the system
    - **Events**: Some event hapens that triggers system processing. Events may have associated data, although this is not always the case
        - ATM example: Data: a user inserts a card; Event: a user presses a button
    - a procedure call can be thought of as an event 

# Data-driven modeling
- many systems are data-processing systems that are primarily driven by data. They are controlled by the data input to the system, with relatively little external event processing. 
- Data-driven models show the sequence off actions involved in processing input data and generating an associated output
- super useful during analysis requirements as they can be used to show end to end processing in a system
- **Check example in folder** 
    - an example of a data-driven system is a smoke detector
        - the smoke detector responds to something which is driven by the environment (the fumes)
        - if the smoke detector is triggered, it will send a signal to the alarm system

# Event-driven modeling
- Real-time systems are often event-driven, with minimal data processing. 
    - Atm example: the ATM system is event-driven, with the events being the user's actions. 
- Event-driven modeling shows how a system responds to external and internal events. 
- Event-driven modeling is based on the assumption that a system has a finite number of states and that events (stimuli) may cause a transition from one state to another. 

# Static machine models
- State machines model the behaviour of the system in response to external and internal events.
- State machine models show system states as nodes and events as arcs between these nodes. When an event occurs, the system moves from one state to another.
- **Check example in folder**

# Modeling software structure
- structureal models of software display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up that system and their relationships
- structure models show 
    - how a software system should be organized
        - for embedded systems, this may include the hardware components
    - the linkage of requirements engineering to detailed design
        - for embedded systems, this may include the additional requirements such as power and battery management

# Class diagrams - lower level structure
- used when devoping object-oriented system model to show the classes in a system and the associations between these classes
- An object class can be thought of as a general definition of one kind of system object, one that **knows things** and **knows how to do things**
    - the objects have attributes (things they know) and methods (things they can do)
- An association is a link between classes that indicates that there is some relationship between these classes.
- When you are developing models during the early stages of the software engineering process, objects often represent something in the real world, such as a patient, a prescription, doctor, etc.

# UML classes and association p29
- multiplicity is important. Patient and patient record is a 1 to 1 relationship, becuase there can only be one patient record for each patient.
- 1..* means that there can be one or more of the associated class

# Generalization
- an everyday technique we use to manage complexity
- rather than learn the detailed characteristics of every entity that we experience, we place those entities in more gernal classes and learn the characteristics of these classes
    - ex: rodents is a generic class that includes mice, rats, and squirrels; the characteristics of rodents are their size, their diet, their habitat, etc
- in object oreiented languages, such as Java and Python, generalization is implemented using the class inheritance mechanism built into the language
- in a generalizationm the attrubutes and operations associated with higher level classes are inherited by the lower level classes
- the lower level classes then add more specific attributes and operations

# Object class aggregation models
- aggregation model shows how classes can be composed of other classes
- aggregation models are similar to the **part of** relatio ship in the semantic data models
- composition is a form of aggregation
- compositions are **whole part** relationships where the lifetume of the part is dependent on the lifetue of the whole **(See class agregation example in folder)**

# Architectural/modeling views
- includes logical, physical, development, and process views
- a view (a diagram) is only a single rendering of some aspect of the software
- each model captures a perspective useful when describing and understanding a system

# 4 + 1 View Model of Software Architecture" by Kruchten:

Logical View:
Focuses on the system's data and methods
Includes objects and object classes

Process View:
Describes an "alive view" of interacting processes

Physical View:
Concerns the software's distribution across hardware
Includes communication aspects

Development View:
Software is decomposed for development purposes

Use Case View/Scenarios:
Requirements are utilized as test cases for the architecture

# Summary
- Modeling provides abstract perspectives of a software's functionality based on its requirements.
- Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly applied in software system modeling.
- Structures of software systems are frequently represented using object class diagrams.
- Use case and sequence diagrams are often employed to depict interactions.
- State transition diagrams are utilized to illustrate event-driven sequences.
-  combination of multiple diagrammatic views is necessary to convey and comprehend the software design.
