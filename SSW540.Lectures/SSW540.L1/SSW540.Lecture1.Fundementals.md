# Software Development Processes
## Process Models - Abstrtact representations

### Fundemental activities 
    - Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints
    - Development - production of the software system
    - Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants. Also known as VnV (Verification and Validation)
    - Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands


## Software process models 
- The waterfall model
    - a clear, plan driven model. Is not eqasy to change. In order to incorporate a change, you must complete the waterfall then start from the beginning again. Seperate and distinct phases of specification and development.Requires a lot of documentation.
- Incremental development
    - specification, development, and validation are interleaved. May be plan driven or agile
- Integration and configuration
    - the system is assembled from existing configurable components. For instance, taking software A and software B to make software C; existing templates, thus less code. May be plan driven or agile

In practice. most large systems are developed using a process that incorporates elements form all of these models. 

## Plan-driven and agile development
- plan druven processes are whhere activitities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan

- in agile, planning is incremental and it is easuer tp change to reflect changing customer requirements
- agile code focused on code rather than design
- agile methods are intended to deliver working software quickly and evolve this quickly to meet changing requirements

## Agile method applicability
- Development of small or medium sizwed projectes/products
    - many saleable software products and apps are now developed using an agile approach
- custom system development within an org
    - must be a clear commitmnet from the customer tyo become involved in the development process
    - where there are few external rules and regulatrions to impact the software
- agile requires a skilled and commited development team
    - all members must be trained in the agile method and have experience in its use
    - team members must be empowered to make decisions
    - the team must be business savvy and have a good understanding of the orgs business goals

## Some Agile development techniques
- User stories expressing requirements
- Pair programming, collective ownership of code (one driver for the main code, one navigator to check for errors)
- Test-driven development â€” testing after every code change
- Constant refactoring to maintain simplicity of the code
- Continuous integration
- Small system releases supporting frequent changes
- Extensive customer involvement

## Agile Project Management
- Agile project management is based on the idea of incremental development, where the project is divided into a series of increments, each of which is planned and delivered as a separate mini-project
- Scrum is an agile project management method focused on managhing iterative development
- Scrum is a lightweight process for managing and controlling agile development

## Scrum benefits 
- The product is broken down into a set of manageable and understandable chunks.
- Unstable requirements do not hold up progress.
- The whole team have visibility of everything (progress and backlog) and consequently team communication is improved.
- Customers see on-time delivery of inqrements and gain feedback on how the product works.
- Trust between customers and developers is established and a positive culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.

## Issues with scaling agile methods
- Agile methods are designed for small, co-located teams working on non-critical systems
- Agile methods may be difficult to scale up for large systems and for large development teams
- Issues:
    - Requirements may be emergent but the overall system architecture may be defined in advance
    - Requirements change may be difficult to manage
    - System structure or organization may be inherently difficult to modularize and componentize
    - System interfaces may be complex and difficult to specify completely in advance
    - System performance may be emergent and may be difficult to assess until system testing
    - System distribution may be inherently difficult to achieve with an agile approach

## One solution: Multi-team Scrum
- Role replication
    - ech teram has a product owner and a scrum master
- product architects
    - each team chooses a product architect and these architects callovorate to design and evolve te overall system architecture
- Release alignment
    - the dates of product releases from each team are aligned so that a demostratable and complete system is produced
- Scrum of scrums
    - There is a daily scum of scryms where representitives from eacg team meet to discuss progress and plan work to be done. 

## Process measurement
- Whenever possible, quantitative process data should be collected
- Some possible metrics:
    - time taken for process activities to be completed (calender time or effort to complete an activity or process)
    - resources required for perocess activities (total effort in person-days)
    - number of occurrences of a particular event (number of defects discovered)
- process measurements allowone to assess process improvements
